The purpose of this 4th-semester project was to design and code an interface in the theme of connecting people. We identify a problem regarding safety in nightlife and work from the problem statement:

"How can we develop an interface that promotes safety and connectedness between friends?"

The overall focus was to improve safety by connecting friends. Through our design process, we created a prototype and afterwards we conducted an evaluation of the prototype. To design a prototype, we followed the Double Diamond of Design to guide our process in designing, researching the scope, involving users, coding, and evaluating our concept. In this process, we involved users to improve our understanding of the problem field and to help evaluate our prototype.

Our product was an app called Sapheus that helps friends know if everyone is safe.
